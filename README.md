## Notes
- I have never written unit testing in Flutter, but I will search for online tutorials and courses on Udemy or any learning platform to learn how to do it
- I have researched a great deal and gained a lot more insights of about Flutter to implement the requirements, and had included all the sources that I used to implement this UI.
